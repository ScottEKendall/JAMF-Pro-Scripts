## JAMF Configuration Profile Search

This script is designed to search thru all of your configuration profiles for a particular string (or key).

Whats the need for this?  Say you are a new employee that just took over your MDM from your (previous) co-workers, or your have so many Config Profiles that you don't remember everything that you put in each one.  That is where this utility comes in handy!  Enter your search word/key and it will search thru all of the Config Profiles and let you know where it found that particular string.
