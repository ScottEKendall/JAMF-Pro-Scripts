## View Inventory

I don't really want the Help Desk team to go into the JAMF server if it all possible, so I created this script so that the helpdesk team (or anyone) can view details about their system. You can either view the inventory of your local system or pull any JAMF registerd device inventory.

**View Local Inventory**

**View Remote Inventory** (will be prompted for JAMF device/hostname)
