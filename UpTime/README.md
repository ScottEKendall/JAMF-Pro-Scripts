#!/bin/sh

uptimeOutput=$(uptime)

#detect "day" by removal and then string comparison, awk gets number of days between "up " and  " day"

[[ "${uptimeOutput/day/}" != "${uptimeOutput}" ]] && uptimeDays=$(awk -F "up | day" '{print $2}' <<< "${uptimeOutput}")

echo "<result>${uptimeDays:-0}</result>"
```
