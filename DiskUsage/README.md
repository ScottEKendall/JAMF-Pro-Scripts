## Disk Usage Scanner

Quick script to display the largest files & folders in the User's home folder.  The starting location & scanning depth are set by script variables (or can be imported via script parameters).  Optionally, if you have Grand Perspective installed, it will notify the user and give them the option to launch that app.
