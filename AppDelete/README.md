## App Delete


This script is designed to allow non-admin users the ability to remove applications from the /Applications folder.  You can control what applications they are not allowed to remove by putting items into the _MANAGED_APPS_ array.  It automaticaly excludes the preinstalled items that come with the OS.

Picture of what the end users see when they run it:
