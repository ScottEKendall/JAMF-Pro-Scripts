## PPPC Nudge

This script allows you to display a dialog informing the user what to do if a particular setting is not set properly in the System Settings > Privacy & Security pane.

This can be modified to handle any TCC Key value that is present on the system.  The JSON Blob ```tccJSONarray``` contains the information to search & retreive for any given TCC Key

*This script is designed to test/evaluate the current condition of the PPPC Key.  If everything seems OK (enabled), it will exit quietly with no user interaction, so theoretically you could scope this to all users...*

## What is the TCC Database? ##

The Apple TCC database, short for Transparency, Consent, and Control database, is a critical component of macOS's privacy protection system. It's a SQLite database that stores user-granted permissions for applications accessing sensitive data and system resources. This ensures that applications only access what the user has explicitly allowed, enhancing user privacy and control. 

**TCC Database locations**

A user-specific TCC database is located at ```~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db```

a system-wide TCC database is located at ```/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db. ```

**TCC for the User**

From a userâ€™s perspective, they see TCC in action when an application wants access to one of the features protected by TCC. When this happens the user is prompted with a dialog asking them whether they want to allow access or not. This response is then stored in the TCC database.

To get visibility into TCC permissions, users can navigate to their System Settings, and click into Privacy & Security. In this pane, you can see the vast majority of TCC permissions. This includes, but is not limited to, applications that have requested access to the camera or microphone, location data, and specific files and folders such as the Desktop or Documents.

**Accessing the TCC Database**

You can access the contents of the TCC database using several methods.  If you want to view the available keys:

```
cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support
strings tccd | grep -iEo "^kTCCService.*" | sort
```

you can also access the service data from SQL

```
sqlite3 "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db"
SQLite version 3.43.2 2023-10-10 13:08:14
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> select DISTINCT service from access;
kTCCServiceAccessibility
kTCCServiceDeveloperTool
kTCCServiceListenEvent
kTCCServicePostEvent
kTCCServiceScreenCapture
kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles
sqlite> 
```

List of apps based on access rights

```
sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \
'select client from access where auth_value and service = "kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles"'
```
will produce an output like this:

```
/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper
com.ninxsoft.mist
com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred
```

To print out the schema of the database you can run ```.schema```


## Jamf Workflow ##

An example JAMF workflow to notify users if access is not set properly

**Extension Attribute**


Name: Disabled System TCC Values
```
#!/bin/zsh

#Extension Attribute reports disabled system level TCC values
#Report Machine's disabled TCC values (Note, this does not include user level TCC results, i.e. Camera and Microphone)

service_name="kTCCServiceScreenCapture"
disabledValues=$(sudo sqlite3 "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db" 'SELECT client FROM access WHERE service like "'$service_name'" and auth_value = "0"')

echo "<result>$disabledValues</result>"
```
**Smart Group:**
Name: &lt;AppName&gt; ScreenSharing Disabled

Criteria:

**Disabled System TCC Values** is not &lt;Leave Blank&gt;

And **Disabled System TCC Values** like ```com.google.Chrome```

**Policy**

Name: Prompt User to enable &lt;AppName&gt; ScreenSharing

Frequency: Once every day

Trigger: Check-in

Scope: AppName ScreenSharing Disabled

Script: PPPCNudge.sh




## MDM Overrides ##

One odd caveat of TCC is the MDMOverrides.plist located in the same com.apple.TCC directory. This binary property list contains MDM-specific TCC permissions. Via MDMs, administrators can deploy payloads, called PPPC payloads, that get added to the System Settings > Profiles. Here, admins can specify TCC permissions they want enabled or not. This is paramount in allowing admins to deploy software silently, run commands on the endpoint, and lots more. 

However, because these permissions are added to the MDMOverrides.plist, as opposed to the TCC.db, they sometimes go unreflected in the UI. This can make triage of deployment issues tedious while attempting to cross reference files. In the meantime, most users cannot assist since the UI goes unchanged.

The per-user `TCC.db` file has the same schema but will commonly have different service types.

Some service types are saved per-user (e.g. camera access) and some are global and will therefore persist in the system-wide `TCC.db` (e.g. Full Disk Access).

Here are some common types:

- `kTCCServiceLiverpool`: Location services access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceUbiquity`: iCloud access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDesktopFolder`: Desktop folder access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceCalendar`: Calendar access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceReminders`: Access to reminders, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceMicrophone`: Microphone access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceCamera`: Camera access, saved in the user-specific TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`: Full disk access capabilities, saved in the system-wide TCC database.
- `kTCCServiceScreenCapture`: Screen capture capabilities, saved in the system-wide TCC database.

## Accessing System Settings panels from Terminal ##

You can use the `strings` command to show you a list of all the privacy settings that can be accessed via terminal:

```
strings "/System/Library/ExtensionKit/Extensions/SecurityPrivacyExtension.appex/Contents/MacOS/SecurityPrivacyExtension" | grep "Privacy_"

Privacy_AppleIntelligenceReport
Privacy_DevTools
Privacy_Automation
Privacy_NudityDetection
Privacy_Location
Privacy_LocationServices
Privacy_SystemServices
Privacy_ScreenCapture
Privacy_AudioCapture
Privacy_Advertising
Privacy_Analytics
Privacy_FilesAndFolders
Privacy_DesktopFolder
Privacy_DocumentsFolder
Privacy_DownloadsFolder
Privacy_NetworkVolume
Privacy_RemovableVolume
Privacy_Accessibility
Privacy_Microphone
Privacy_Calendars
Privacy_Pasteboard
Privacy_Camera
Privacy_Photos
```

You can display individual settings by using this command: 
```
LOGGED_IN_USER=$( scutil <<< "show State:/Users/ConsoleUser" | awk '/Name :/ && ! /loginwindow/ { print $3 }' )

function runAsUser () 
{  
  if [ "$LOGGED_IN_USER" != "loginwindow" ]; then
    launchctl asuser "$UID" sudo -u "$LOGGED_IN_USER" "$@"
  else
    echo "no user logged in"
    # uncomment the exit command to make the function exit with an error when no user is logged in
    # exit 1
  fi
}

runAsUser open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ScreenCapture"
```

All System settings panes can be opened via terminal, here is a complete article on it:
