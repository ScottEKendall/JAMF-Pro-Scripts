## Dialog Message

I create a "generic" dialog message that can be used to send out message to JAMF users.  Great for annoucning items like upcoming OS releases... The timer was put it to make sure that the dialog gets dismissed and doesn't hang up any policies from being run.

The parameters page of the system script allows for a wide variety of customization
