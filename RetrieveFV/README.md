## Retrieve FileVault Password

Trying to create a series of scripts to assist the HelpDesk in doing some macOS Support.  I don't want to give them access the JAMF as it would be way to confusing for them.  They can find the system by either Serial # or by HostName, and they have to give a reason for the pull.
