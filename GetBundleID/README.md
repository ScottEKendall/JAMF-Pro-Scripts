## JAMF Binary Self Heal   

As of JAMF 10.36, we have the ability to send out a command for the JAMF binary to "self heal" itself.  Useful for when you get the dreaded "Device Signature failure".  I have found in my testing, that once this command is sent to the device, it will also trigger the enrollment process as well.
