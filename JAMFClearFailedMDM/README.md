## Clear failed MDM Commands


Nice GUI method of clearing out failed MDM Commands from a machine record.  Sometimes failed commands will prevent JAMF from processing further commands

Initial Welcome screen

![](/ClearFailedMDM/ClearFailedMDM_welcome.png)

Good (Not failures found) results

![](/ClearFailedMDM/ClearFailedMDM_good.png)

Failed commands found

![](/ClearFailedMDM/ClearFailedMDM_fail.png)

Kudos to Karthikeyan Marappan for coming up with the concept.  I just put a nice GUI frontend to it.
