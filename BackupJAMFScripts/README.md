## Backup of JAMF system scripts

This script is designed to extract all of the system scripts from your JAMF server.  Why do you want to do this?

1.  Make a backup of your scripts in case your existing backup files is missing/corrupted (or you don't have one!)
2.  You inhereited a JAMF server from another person, and this can do a "brain dump" so you can review the scripts.
3.  Why not?  It is another example of what you can do with API scripts..

Process Screen

Errors window

At some point, I might combine both this script and my [BackupSSscripts](https://github.com/ScottEKendall/JAMF-Pro-Scripts/tree/main/BackupSSIcons) into one and make a "common" JAMF utility..just wanted to get this out now...
