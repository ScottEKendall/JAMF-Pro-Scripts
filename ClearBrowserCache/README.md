## Clear Browser Cache

This one grew out of necessity at my old job.  The higher level VPs didn't want to go into each browser settings and clear their cache/cookies/history when asked to do so, so I tried to create a "one stop shop" to work on all installed browsers with a single click.  The goal was to keep their bookmarks, extensions & tabs intact...and it works "for the most part".
